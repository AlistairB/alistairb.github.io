Almost exactly one year ago I quit my job to attempt to create a Haskell startup as a solo developer. I had about 20 ideas, but eventually settled on the idea of dependency project health tracking with [Deadpendency](https://deadpendency.com/).

## Why Use Haskell?

Since about 2016 I developed a strong ~~obsession~~ love of Haskell. Prior to learning Haskell, I was an experienced OO style developer and didn't really know how to improve my raw programming ability. Haskell introduced me to the world of FP which has an almost infinite depth of concepts to learn that can be leveraged to improve code quality and application architecture.

Haskell is challenging to learn, but extremely fun to write. For my own learning and pleasure, if my startup succeeds, I want to be doing Haskell.

Additionally, I think Haskell is the best general purpose programming language (that you can use in production). In particular, Haskell excells at writing 'boring' business applications which is typically what I work on. Having said that, there are many reasons why a team may not want to select Haskell as their language such as challenges of skilling up the team. For a solo startup, where I already know Haskell to a reasonable degree, these are not issues so I don't need to worry.

['Why Haskell For Production'](https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/) goes into more detail on the benefits Haskell offers.

## The Setup Phase

Probably the most challenging part was building out a skeleton architecture to hang my code on. I decided to go with, even within Haskell, fairly advanced libraries of `[servant](https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/)` and `[fused-effects](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects)`.

I spent a fair amount of time banging my head against a wall trying to get these libraries working nicely together. Part of this was a lack of Haskell knowledge as needed to skill up to.
