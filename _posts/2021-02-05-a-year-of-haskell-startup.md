Almost exactly one year ago I quit my job to attempt to create a Haskell startup as a solo developer. I had about 20 ideas, but eventually settled on the idea of dependency project health tracking with [Deadpendency](https://deadpendency.com/).

## Why Use Haskell?

Since about 2016 I developed a strong ~~obsession~~ love of Haskell. Prior to learning Haskell, I was an experienced OO style developer but I didn't really know how to keep improving my raw programming ability. Haskell introduced me to the world of FP which has an almost infinite depth of concepts to learn that can be leveraged to improve code quality and application architecture.

Haskell is challenging to learn, but extremely fun to write. For my own learning and pleasure, if my startup succeeds, I want to be doing Haskell.

Additionally, I think Haskell is the best general purpose programming language (that you can use in production). In particular, Haskell excells at writing 'boring' business applications which is typically what I work on. ['Why Haskell For Production'](https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/) goes into more detail on the benefits Haskell offers.

## The Setup Phase

Probably the most challenging part was building out a skeleton architecture to hang my code on. I decided to go with, even within Haskell, fairly advanced libraries of [`servant`](https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/) and [`fused-effects`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects).

I spent a fair amount of time banging my head against a wall trying to get these libraries to work nicely together. This was a primarily from a lack of Haskell ability on my part. I had prepared as best I could, but Haskell is deep and I needed to learn more to work day to day with it. I was lucky enough to eventually find [an example](https://github.com/mitchellwrosen/hspolls) that marries these two libraries together, which was a life saver. I'm sure I would have gotten there eventually, but I was in a bit over my head at that point.

Haskell is awesome, but like most languages there is cruft and legacy to be avoided. Haskell has a standard library known as [`base`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base) which unfortunately has a fair amount of unsafe or unperformant functions included. As such I went with an alternative standard library [`relude`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude) that builds on and improves `base`. On top of this, there are many core libraries that are not part of the standard library I wanted to use and have nice patterns around.

Additionally, I was [deploying to google cloud](/haskell-on-google-cloud-is-great) and so needed to figure out good patterns for that integration from Haskell.

This setup effort was quite challenging, yet it only took about 2 weeks to have a good foundation of code to start building my business logic upon.

## Building It Out

This is when it started to get really fun. I had my core patterns set out and I could focus on building a pipeline. The day in day out of writing out my logic as small pure functions that I composed together was very nice.

Haskell has such impressive auto-magic code generation techniques that you spend much more time focused on the interesting logic of your application not boilerplate.

```haskell
data HappinessLevel =
    Miserable
  | Sad
  | Average
  | Happy
  | SuperFantastic
  deriving (Show, Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum, ToJSON, FromJSON) -- magic code generation

-- ok not really magic, think 'convention over configuration'
-- where you can have generated sane defaults, or customise if you like
```

And personally I think Haskell is quite beautiful to read and write. #notbiased

### Parsing Libraries

A lot of the logic of Deadpendency is parsing. Either parsing dependency files or parsing various API responses. Haskell has many excellent parsing libraries, most notably [`aeson`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) for JSON.

Why is this nice in Haskell? The 'monad' abstraction is excellent for dealing with code with a lot of failure conditions (ie. parsing) and avoids 'pyramid of doom' type code. Haskell worked out really well in this key area.

### Testing

Another strong positive for writing Deadpendency was testing. Haskell has a lesser known style of testing libraries that do 'property based testing' (PBT).

PBT allows you to write value generators for your data types, which you use to generate 100s or 1000s of test cases. Then, you run these generated values against some function and check that certain properties hold.

For example, part of the Deadpendency logic is generating an HTML report at the end. I had some `toHtml :: Report -> HTML` function that I wanted to test. So I wrote a `fromHtml :: HTML -> Report` function where it goes the other way (ok writing that was pretty painful). Then my PBT test will generate 100s of `Report` values and check that `report == fromHtml (toHtml report)` (this is known as 'roundtrip testing'). With this single test I was able to find many edge case bugs with my HTML report generation logic.

PBT exists in some other languages, but it originated (I believe?) in Haskell so the libraries are excellent.

### Not Actively Maintained Libraries

A big challenge of working with Haskell was the lack of well maintained libraries. Ironically, of the 75 (!) packages I depend upon 19 are flagged by Deadpendency as unhealthy. This means I often don't have the luxury of asking library maintainers to fix bugs. Even if I PR a fix, often that PR will be ignored for months.

This I think is the reality of using a niche language like Haskell. To be clear, I do not think library developers owe me anything, but it is nonetheless a downside when compared to more popular languages.

Thankfully Haskell build tools have good support for loading a package from git. This means you can PR some bug fix or feature and immediately use your fork to work around the problem.

### Refactoring Pain

Deadpendency is relatively simple in what it does, but there is a lot of hidden complexity to the problem. Which is to say, it is like 99% of applications ðŸ˜‰. When developing it I was constantly realising I had modelled things a bit too simplistically and would need to refactor.

Haskell has a smattering [of](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apply-refact) [tools](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retrie) that do refactoring, but they seem difficult to learn and don't seem to do the core refactorings that I want. Namely, move/rename module and rename function/variable name. As such I did it all manually with text search replace, or just change something and fix all the new compiler errors.

The dream of course is nice refactoring built into an IDE.

Having said that, it should be noted that Haskell does have an excellent IDE now in the form of [Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server) (HLS). The momentum around the project is insane and I applaud the developers. One fixed pain point from HLS is it beautifully does auto imports now, which used to greatly contribute to the friction of working with Haskell.

### Waiting For GHC Updates To Be Usable

This is mostly me complaining for the sake of it, but as someone pretty obsessed with new shiny versions of things and being obessed with Haskell, waiting for new GHC (GHC is the Haskell compiler) versions to be usable has been painful. There is a long tail of libraries and platforms that need to be updated before I can use a new GHC versions. Sometimes these updates can drag a lot.

For example GHC 9 was just released, but I still haven't been able to upgrade to the GHC 8.10 yet which was first released in March 2020.

## Launching

### Very few logic bugs

### Too strict talking to external services

### Memory issues
