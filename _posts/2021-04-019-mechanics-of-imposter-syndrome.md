Like many working in IT, I have experienced imposter syndrome. What is imposter syndrome?

Wikipedia states:

> Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills, talents or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

In my experience, it is more mild than an actual fear of being exposed as a fraud. I would describe it as a feeling of unease about my abilities as a programmer.

## My Experience

I would say for most of my career I have experienced it in the following way.

1. I have positive and negative experiences as a programmer. Some have bolstered my confidence and some detracted from it. On the whole most seemed to be positive.
2. Ultimately, I don't really know how good I am. I think I am decent, but what about the times I have made mistakes?
3. I could do an analysis on the matter, but maybe I get the analysis wrong? Or it is quickly invalided as I have new good and bad experiences?

In short, the inability to conclusively say 'I am a good programmer' leaves a sense of unease that, 'maybe I'm not so good of a programmer'.

I don't have the fear that I am a complete fraud, just that I am not as good as I think, or as good as others seem to think of me.

I have the impression this is how most people in IT experience it, but I could be wrong.

## It's Not All Bad

Of course
