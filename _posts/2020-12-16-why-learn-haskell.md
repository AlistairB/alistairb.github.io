[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is a lazy, purely functional programming language. I believe it is one of the most useful languages to learn for most developers.

## Why Learn Any New Language

Learning a new programming language is a great way to improve as a programmer. Each language has its own unique take on things and will have some great ideas.

I ended up working in Ruby for a few years when at the time I was much more interested in working in Scala. I was sad about this at the time. However, learning Ruby ended up teaching me quite a lot. For example, I had not done strict TDD before which is very popular in Ruby. I learnt the pros and cons of this approach and I can now apply it well when needed.

Usually these new learnings are not strictly tied to the new language. You can take them and use them in many different programming languages.

## Ok but why learn Haskell

When learning a new programming language, it is usually best to choose some language that is very different from your known programming languages. For example, if you know Ruby you probably wouldn't get a huge amount out of learning Python, as they are quite similar.

Most developers are more familiar with object orientated languages which is why learning a functional language can be so fruitful. And indeed, functional programming principles can be applied in OO style lanugages.
