I created this thing called [Deadpendency](https://deadpendency.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which is a GitHub app which checks for dead dependencies in your GitHub repo.

There were some [trials and tribulations](/my-experience-creating-a-one-person-startup), but ultimately I was successful and I built the thing. In Haskell no less, which [worked out pretty great](/reflections-on-haskell-for-startup)!

Unfortunately, the product itself was not successful at getting paid users and I [pulled the plug](/shutting-down-deadpendency).

I have decided to open source it, so at least it might still serve some purpose!

## What Is Deadpendency?

tl;dr

## Why Open Source It?

In a nutshell, I don't have plans to work on it anymore, so it can at least have a chance of providing others some value if it is open source. I am generally quite proud of it

More specifically, which might you care?

### A Haskell 'DevOps' Pattern

Probably the best aspect
