title: "What It Is Like To Start A Tiny Startup Yourself"

I quit my job as a software developer to create a small GitHub app that I hope to sell. I started working on this idea fulltime from Feb and I'm about 6 weeks out from launching.

In a lot of ways it has been quite challenging and I've had some learnings I'd like to share.

## I Am Uniquely Privelaged

I am lucky enough to have the savings to comfortably quit my job for 1 year and not have to worry about money. The project I am doing is small enough that I don't need any capital, just my time to see it through. This has enabled me to set some unusual rules for my startup.

- The work has to be enjoyable.
- I should push my limits and learn new things.

To me this is not the stereotype of a startup. I assume most startups will be churning out low quality applications to minimise investment and the test the idea. However, this is just not a rewarding way to develop for me so I haven't gone in this direction.

## Technological Freedom Is Awesome

Businesses are fairly conservative with technology choices. They want the tried and true that will give them a reliable return on investment. Conversely developers want to keep improving and learning new things. Always sticking to well established tech can feel cumbersome at times when you know new tech could add a lot of value.

The best thing about starting your own startup (if you have the luxury) is working with tech that is hard to get approved in most companies. In my case I am writing the app in Haskell among other new (for me) tech choices.

This has been a great learning opportunity that even if my startup completely fails I will consider worth it.

## I'm Learning So Much! But I have noone to share it with :(

Working by yourself is extremely challenging. Even though the tech I am using is awesome to work with and I am learning a lot, it is lonely and unmotivating working alone. Day to day I am actually less happy that when I was working at my previous company with collegues. This is inspite of all the great things about this new challenge.

I keep learning new things and want to share it, but I have no teammates anymore. Staying motivated is obviously difficult in these circumstances.

## Teams do great work, not individuals

This is a personal belief of mine. Humans have evolved to operate together in tribes and I think we will work best with many people, ideally with diverse backgrounds and experience.

Working by yourself is frankly scary! Everyone makes mistakes and there is no safety net
